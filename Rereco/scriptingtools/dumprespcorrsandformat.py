# This program takes the HcalClosureTest code's generated response corrections and reformats them so they can be used in the rereco routine.
# It needs a template of reference HCAL response corrections, referred to as "template", and the response corrections from HcalClosureTest, referred to as "file".
# It creates the formatted HCAL response corrections that are ready to go into the rereco, referred to as "out_file".
